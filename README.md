# Wordle Clone

Our web application begins by displaying a welcome screen that requires users to enter their name and email, which we’ll use to personalize the game interface. 

Once they enter that information, the game page will be displayed. On the game page, the user will be presented with a text box to ether their guess. 

Once the user enters a guess, if they are incorrect, the game page will be displayed again, showing their previous guesses and how close they were. That is, we’ll tell the user:
- How many characters in their guess were in the correct position
- How many characters in their guess were in the target word
- Whether their word was longer, shorter, or the same length as the target word. 

Users may continue guessing until they guess the word, at which point they will be taken to a Game Over screen displaying the results of their game. Users will be prompted to enter their name and email, they will be able to see their prior guesses, and their sessions will be tracked.
